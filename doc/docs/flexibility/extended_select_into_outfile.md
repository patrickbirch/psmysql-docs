# Extended `SELECT INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE`

*Percona Server for MySQL* has extended the `SELECT INTO ... OUTFILE` and `SELECT INTO DUMPFILE` [commands](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select-into.html) to add the support for UNIX sockets and named pipes. Before this was implemented the database would return an error for such files.

This feature allows using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` in combination with `SELECT INTO OUTFILE` to quickly load multiple partitions across the network or in other setups, without having to use an intermediate file which wastes space and I/O.

## Version Specific Information


* Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10-1: Feature ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6
