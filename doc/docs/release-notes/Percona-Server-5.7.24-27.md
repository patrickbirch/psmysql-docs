!!! note

    If youâ€™re currently using *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7, Percona recommends upgrading to this version of 5.7 prior to upgrading to *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.

## Bugs Fixed

* When uninstalling *Percona Server for MySQL* packages on *CentOS 7* default
configuration file `my.cnf` would get removed as well. This fix
makes the backup of the configuration file instead of removing it.
Bug fixed [#5092](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5092).
