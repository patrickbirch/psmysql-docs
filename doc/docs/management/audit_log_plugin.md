# Audit Log Plugin

Percona Audit Log Plugin provides monitoring and logging of connection and query activity that were performed on specific server. Information about the activity will be stored in the XML log file where each event will have its `NAME` field, its own unique `RECORD_ID` field and a `TIMESTAMP` field. 


Audit logging documents the database usage. You can use the log for troubleshooting.

## Installation

Audit Log plugin is installed with *Percona Server for MySQL*, but is not enabled by default. You can verify if the plugin is enabled by running the following commands:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM information_schema.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%audit%';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Empty set (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SHOW variables LIKE 'audit%';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Empty set (0.01 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SHOW variables LIKE 'plugin%';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
+---------------+------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value                  |
+---------------+------------------------+
| plugin_dir    | /usr/lib/mysql/plugin/ |
+---------------+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

!!! note

    The location of the MySQL plugin directory depends on the operating system and may be different.

The following command enables the plugin:

```sql
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN audit_log SONAME 'audit_log.so';
```

Run the following command to verify if the plugin was installed correctly:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM information_schema.PLUGINS WHERE PLUGIN_NAME LIKE '%audit%'\G
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
*************************** 1. row ***************************
          PLUGIN_NAME: audit_log
        PLUGIN_VERSION: 0.2
        PLUGIN_STATUS: ACTIVE

```

You can review the audit log variables with the following command:

```sql

mysql> SHOW variables LIKE 'audit%';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text

```

Audit Log plugin produces the log of following events:

* **Audit** - Audit event indicates that audit logging started or finished. `NAME` field will be `Audit` when logging started and `NoAudit` when logging finished. Audit record also includes server version and command-line arguments.

Example of the Audit event:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD
  NAME="Audit"
  RECORD="1_2021-06-30T11:56:53"
  TIMESTAMP="2021-06-30T11:56:53 UTC"
  MYSQL_VERSION="5.7.34-37"
  STARTUP_OPTIONS="--daemonize --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid"
  OS_VERSION="x86_64-debian-linux-gnu"
/>
```

* **Connect**/**Disconnect** - Connect record event will have `NAME` field `Connect` when user logged in or login failed, or `Quit` when connection is closed.

Additional fields for this event are the following:

* `CONNECTION_ID`

* `STATUS`

* `USER`

* `PRIV_USER`

* `OS_LOGIN`

* `PROXY_USER`

* `HOST`

* `IP`

The value for `STATUS` is `0` for successful logins and non-zero for failed logins.

Example of the Disconnect event:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD
  NAME="Quit"
  RECORD="5_2021-06-29T19:33:03"
  TIMESTAMP="2021-06-29T19:34:38Z"
  CONNECTION_ID="14"
  STATUS="0"
  USER="root"
  PRIV_USER="root"
  OS_LOGIN=""
  PROXY_USER=""
  HOST="localhost"
  IP=""
  DB=""
/>
```

* **Query** - Additional fields for this event are: `COMMAND_CLASS` (values come from the `com_status_vars` array in the `sql/mysqld.cc\`` file in a MySQL source distribution. Examples are`select`,`alter_table`,`create_table`, etc.),`CONNECTION_ID`,`STATUS` (indicates error when non-zero), `SQLTEXT` (text of SQL-statement), `USER`,`HOST`,`OS_USER`,`IP`. Possible values for the`NAME` name field for this event are `Query`,`Prepare`,`Execute`,`Change user`, etc..

**NOTE**: The `statement/sql/%`  populates the audit log command_class field, for example, the `SELECT name FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments WHERE name LIKE "statement/sql/%"` query.

The `%statement/com%` entry populates the audit log command_class field as lowercase text, for example, the `SELECT name FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments WHERE name LIKE '%statement/com%'` query.  If you run a ‘Ping’ command, then the command_class field is ‘ping’, and for ‘Init DB’, the command_class field is ‘init db’.

Example of the Query event:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD
  NAME="Query"
  RECORD="4_2021-06-29T19:33:03"
  TIMESTAMP="2021-06-29T19:33:34Z"
  COMMAND_CLASS="show_variables"
  CONNECTION_ID="14"
  STATUS="0"
  SQLTEXT="show variables like 'audit%'"
  USER="root[root] @ localhost []"
  HOST="localhost"
  OS_USER=""
  IP=""
  DB=""
/>
```

## Log Format

The audit log plugin supports the following log formats: `OLD`, `NEW`, `JSON`, and `CSV`. The `OLD\`\`format and the\`\`NEW` format are based on XML. The `OLD` format defines each log record with XML attributes. The `NEW` format defines each log record with XML tags. The information logged is the same for all four formats. The audit_log_format variable controls the log format choice.

An example of the `OLD` format:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD
  NAME="Query"
  RECORD="3_2021-06-30T11:56:53"
  TIMESTAMP="2021-06-30T11:57:14 UTC"
  COMMAND_CLASS="select"
  CONNECTION_ID="3"
  STATUS="0"
  SQLTEXT="select * from information_schema.PLUGINS where PLUGIN_NAME like '%audit%'"
  USER="root[root] @ localhost []"
  HOST="localhost"
  OS_USER=""
  IP=""
  DB=""
/>
```

An example of the `NEW` format:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD>
  <NAME>Query</NAME>
  <RECORD>16684_2021-06-30T16:07:41</RECORD>
  <TIMESTAMP>2021-06-30T16:08:06 UTC</TIMESTAMP>
  <COMMAND_CLASS>select</COMMAND_CLASS>
  <CONNECTION_ID>2</CONNECTION_ID>
  <STATUS>0</STATUS>
  <SQLTEXT>select id, holder from one</SQLTEXT>
  <USER>root[root] @ localhost []</USER>
  <HOST>localhost</HOST>
  <OS_USER></OS_USER>
  <IP></IP>
  <DB></DB>
```

An example of the `JSON` format:

```json
{"audit_record":{"name":"Query","record":"13149_2021-06-30T15:03:11","timestamp":"2021-06-30T15:07:58 UTC","command_class":"show_databases","connection_id":"2","status":0,"sqltext":"show databases","user":"root[root] @ localhost []","host":"localhost","os_user":"","ip":"","db":""}}
```

An example of the `CSV` format:

```csv
"Query","22567_2021-06-30T16:10:09","2021-06-30T16:19:00 UTC","select","2",0,"select count(*) from one","root[root] @ localhost []","localhost","","",""
```

## Streaming the audit log to syslog

To stream the audit log to syslog you’ll need to set audit_log_handler variable to `SYSLOG`. To control the syslog file handler, the following variables can be used: audit_log_syslog_ident, audit_log_syslog_facility, and audit_log_syslog_priority These variables have the same meaning as appropriate parameters described in the [syslog(3) manual](http://linux.die.net/man/3/syslog).

!!! note

    The actions for the variables: audit_log_strategy, audit_log_buffer_size, audit_log_rotate_on_size, audit_log_rotations are captured only with `FILE` handler.

## Filtering by user

In Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.14-7 *Percona Server for MySQL* has implemented filtering by user. This
was implemented by adding two new global variables:
audit_log_include_accounts and
audit_log_exclude_accounts to specify which user accounts should be
included or excluded from audit logging.

!!! warning

    Only one of these variables can contain a list of users to be either included or excluded, while the other needs to be `NULL`. If one of the variables is set to be not `NULL` (contains a list of users), the attempt to set another one will fail. Empty string means an empty list.

!!! note

    Changes of audit_log_include_accounts and audit_log_exclude_accounts do not apply to existing server connections.

### Example

Following example shows adding users who will be monitored:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = 'user1@localhost,root@localhost';
```
The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

If you you try to add users to both include and exclude lists server will show
you the following error:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = 'user1@localhost,root@localhost';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'audit_log_exclude_accounts' can't be set to the value of 'user1@localhost,root@localhost'
```

To switch from filtering by included user list to the excluded one or back,
first set the currently active filtering variable to `NULL`:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_accounts = NULL;
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = 'user1@localhost,root@localhost';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = "'user'@'host'";
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = '''user''@''host''';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = '\'user\'@\'host\'';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

To see what users are currently in the on the list you can run:

```sql
mysql> SELECT @@audit_log_exclude_accounts;
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
+------------------------------+
| @@audit_log_exclude_accounts |
+------------------------------+
| 'user'@'host'                |
+------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Account names from mysql.user table are the one that are logged in the
audit log. For example when you create a user:

```sql
mysql> CREATE USER 'user1'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '111';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

This is what you’ll see when `user1` connected from `localhost`:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD
  NAME="Connect"
  RECORD="2_2021-06-30T11:56:53"
  TIMESTAMP="2021-06-30T11:56:53 UTC"
  CONNECTION_ID="6"
  STATUS="0"
  USER="user1" ;; this is a 'user' part of account in 5.7
  PRIV_USER="user1"
  OS_LOGIN=""
  PROXY_USER=""
  HOST="localhost" ;; this is a 'host' part of account in 5.7
  IP=""
  DB=""
/>
```

To exclude `user1` from logging in *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7 you must set:

```sql
SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_accounts = 'user1@%';
```

The value can be `NULL` or comma separated list of accounts in form
`user@host` or `'user'@'host'` (if user or host contains comma).

## Filtering by SQL command type

In Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.14-7 *Percona Server for MySQL* has implemented filtering by SQL command
type. This was implemented by adding two new global variables:
audit_log_include_commands and
audit_log_exclude_commands to specify which command types should be
included or excluded from audit logging.

!!! warning

    Only one of these variables can contain a list of command types to be either included or excluded, while the other needs to be `NULL`. If one of the variables is set to be not `NULL` (contains a list of command types), the attempt to set another one will fail. Empty string means an empty list.

!!! note

    If both audit_log_exclude_commands and audit_log_include_commands are `NULL` all commands will be logged.

### Example

The available command types can be listed by running:

```sql
mysql> SELECT name FROM performance_schema.setup_instruments WHERE name LIKE "statement/sql/%" ORDER BY name;
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
+------------------------------------------+
| name                                     |
+------------------------------------------+
| statement/sql/alter_db                   |
| statement/sql/alter_db_upgrade           |
| statement/sql/alter_event                |
| statement/sql/alter_function             |
| statement/sql/alter_procedure            |
| statement/sql/alter_server               |
| statement/sql/alter_table                |
| statement/sql/alter_tablespace           |
| statement/sql/alter_user                 |
| statement/sql/analyze                    |
| statement/sql/assign_to_keycache         |
| statement/sql/begin                      |
| statement/sql/binlog                     |
| statement/sql/call_procedure             |
| statement/sql/change_db                  |
| statement/sql/change_master              |
...
| statement/sql/xa_rollback                |
| statement/sql/xa_start                   |
+------------------------------------------+
145 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

You can add commands to the include filter by running:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_commands= 'set_option,create_db';
```

When you create a database with the following command:

```sql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE sample;
```

The action is captured in the audit log:

```text
<AUDIT_RECORD>
  <NAME>Query</NAME>
  <RECORD>24320_2021-06-30T17:44:46</RECORD>
  <TIMESTAMP>2021-06-30T17:45:16 UTC</TIMESTAMP>
  <COMMAND_CLASS>create_db</COMMAND_CLASS>
  <CONNECTION_ID>2</CONNECTION_ID>
  <STATUS>0</STATUS>
  <SQLTEXT>CREATE DATABASE sample</SQLTEXT>
  <USER>root[root] @ localhost []</USER>
  <HOST>localhost</HOST>
  <OS_USER></OS_USER>
  <IP></IP>
  <DB></DB>
</AUDIT_RECORD>
```

To switch command type filtering type from included type list to excluded one
or back, first reset the currently-active list to `NULL`:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_commands = NULL;
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_commands= 'set_option,create_db';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

!!! note

    Invocation of stored procedures have command type `call_procedure`, and all the statements executed within the procedure have the same type `call_procedure` as well.

## Filtering by database

In Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.14-7 *Percona Server for MySQL* has implemented filtering by SQL database.
This was implemented by adding two new global variables:
audit_log_include_databases and
audit_log_exclude_databases to specify which databases should be
included or excluded from audit logging.

!!! warning

    Only one of these variables can contain a list of databases to be either included or excluded, while the other needs to be `NULL`. If one of the variables is set to be not `NULL` (contains a list of databases), the attempt to set another one will fail. Empty string means an empty list.

If query is accessing any of databases listed in
`audit_log_include_databases`, the query will be logged.
If query is accessing only databases listed in
`audit_log_exclude_databases`, the query will not be logged.
`CREATE TABLE` statements are logged unconditionally.

!!! note

    Changes of audit_log_include_databases and audit_log_exclude_databases do not apply to existing server connections.

### Example

To add databases to be monitored you should run:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_databases = 'test,mysql,db1';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_databases= 'db1,db3';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

If you you try to add databases to both include and exclude lists server will
show you the following error:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_databases = 'test,mysql,db1';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'audit_log_exclude_databases can't be set to the value of 'test,mysql,db1'
```

To switch from filtering by included database list to the excluded one or back,
first set the currently active filtering variable to `NULL`:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_include_databases = NULL;
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL audit_log_exclude_databases = 'test,mysql,db1';
```

The output should be similar to the following;

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
