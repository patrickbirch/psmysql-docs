## Bugs Fixed

* When using skip-innodb_doublewrite in my.cnf, a parallel doublewrite buffer is still created. Bugs fixed [#3411](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-3411).

* During a binlogging replication event, if the master crashes after the multi-threaded slave has begun copying to the slave’s relay log and before the process has completed, a STOP SLAVE on the slave takes longer than expected. Bug fixed [#5824](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5824).

* If [pam_krb5](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E88353_01/html/E37853/pam-krb5-7.html) is configured to allow the user to change their password, and the password expired, the server crashed after receiving the new password. Bug fixed [#6023](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-6023).

## Known Issues

* [#5783](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-5783): The length of time and resources required for a MySQL query execution increased with a large number of table partitions. Limiting the Estimation of Records in a Query describes the experimental options added to prevent index scans on the partitions and return a specified number of values.
