# Running Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 in a Docker Container

!!! note

    The following instructions run Percona Server for MySQL 5.7 in a Docker container. 
    The instructions on how to run [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 in a Docker container are available at this location](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/latest/installation/docker.html).


Docker images of Percona Server are hosted publicly on Docker Hub at
[https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-server/](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/percona-server/).

For more information about using Docker, see the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/).

**NOTE**: Make sure that you are using the latest version of Docker.
The ones provided via `apt` and `yum`
may be outdated and cause errors.

**NOTE**: By default, Docker will pull the image from Docker Hub
if it is not available locally.

## Using the Percona Server Images

The following procedure describes how to run and access Percona Server 5.7
using Docker.

### Starting a Percona Server Instance in a Container

To start a container named `ps`
running the latest version in the Percona Server 5.7 series,
with the root password set to `root`:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker run -d \
  --name ps \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  percona/percona-server:5.7
```

**NOTE**: `root` is not a secure password.

**NOTE**: The docker stop command sends a TERM signal. Docker waits 10 seconds
and sends a KILL signal. Very large instances cannot dump the data from
memory to disk in 10 seconds. If you plan to run a very large instance, add
the following option to the docker run command.

â€“stop-timeout 600

### Accessing the Percona Server Container

To access the shell in the container:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker exec -it ps /bin/bash
```

From the shell, you can view the error log:

```
[mysql@ps] $ more /var/log/mysql/error.log
2017-08-29T04:20:22.190474Z 0 [Warning] 'NO_ZERO_DATE', 'NO_ZERO_IN_DATE' and 'ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO' sql modes should be used with strict mode. They will be merged with strict mode in a future release.
2017-08-29T04:20:22.190520Z 0 [Warning] 'NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER' sql mode was not set.
...
```

You can also run the MySQL command-line client
to access the database directly:

```
[mysql@ps] $ mysql -uroot -proot
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```

### Accessing Percona Server from Application in Another Container

The image exposes the standard MySQL port 3306,
so container linking makes Percona Server instance available
from other containers.
To link a container running your application
(in this case, from image named `app/image`)
with the Percona Server container,
run it with the following command:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker run -d \
  --name app \
  --link ps \
  app/image:latest
```

This application container will be able to access the Percona Server container
via port 3306.

## Environment Variables

When running a Docker container with Percona Server,
you can adjust the configuration of the instance
by passing one or more environment variables with the `docker run` command.

**NOTE**: These variables will not have any effect
if you start the container with a data directory
that already contains a database:
any pre-existing database will always remain untouched on container startup.

The variables are optional,
except that you must specify at least one of the following:


* [MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/installation/docker.html#mysql-allow-empty-password): least secure, use only for testing.


* [MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/installation/docker.html#mysql-root-password): more secure,
but setting the password on the command line is not recommended
for sensitive production setups.


* [MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/installation/docker.html#mysql-random-root-password): most secure,
recommended for production.

**NOTE**: To further secure your instance,
use the [MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/installation/docker.html#mysql-onetime-password) variable
if you are running version 5.6 or later.

## Storing Data

There are two ways to store data used by applications
that run in Docker containers:


* Let Docker manage the storage of your data
by writing the database files to disk on the host system
using its own internal volume management.


* Create a data directory on the host system
(outside the container on high performance storage)
and mount it to a directory visible from inside the container.
This places the database files in a known location on the host system,
and makes it easy for tools and applications on the host system
to access the files.
The user should make sure that the directory exists,
and that permissions and other security mechanisms on the host system
are set up correctly.

For example, if you create a data directory on a suitable volume
on your host system named `/local/datadir`,
you run the container with the following command:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker run -d \
  --name ps \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  -v /local/datadir:/var/lib/mysql \
  percona/percona-server:5.7
```

The `-v /local/datadir:/var/lib/mysql` option
mounts the `/local/datadir` directory on the host
to `/var/lib/mysql` in the container,
which is the default data directory used by Percona Server.

**NOTE**: If you the Percona Server container instance
with a data directory that already contains data
(the `mysql` subdirectory where all our system tables are stored),
the [MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/installation/docker.html#mysql-root-password) variable should be omitted
from the `docker run` command.

**NOTE**: If you have SELinux enabled,
assign the relevant policy type to the new data directory,
so that the container will be allowed to access it:

```
[root@docker-host] $ chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /local/datadir
```

## Port Forwarding

Docker allows mapping ports on the container to ports on the host system
using the `-p` option.
If you run the container with this option,
you can connect to the database by connecting your client
to a port on the host machine.
This can greatly simplify consolidating many instances to a single host.

To map the standard MySQL port 3306 to port 6603 on the host:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker run -d \
 --name ps \
 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
 -p 6603:3306 \
 percona/percona-server:5.7
```

## Passing Options to Percona Server

You can pass options to Percona Server when running the container
by appending them to the `docker run` command.
For example, to start run Percona Server with UTF-8
as the default setting for character set
and collation for all databases:

```
[root@docker-host] $ docker run -d \
 --name ps \
 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
 percona/percona-server:5.7 \
 --character-set-server=utf8 \
 --collation-server=utf8_general_ci
```
