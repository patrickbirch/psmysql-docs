## Bugs Fixed

When a stored routine would call an administrative command such as
`OPTIMIZE TABLE`, `ANALYZE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE/DROP INDEX`,
etc. the effective value of `log_slow_sp_statements` was overwritten
by the value of `log_slow_admin_statements`. Bug fixed
[#719368](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/719368).

The server wouldn’t start after crash with with `innodb_force_recovery`
set to `6` if a parallel doublewrite file existed. Bug fixed [#1629879](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/1629879).

The Thread Pool `thread limit reached` and `failed to create thread`
messages are now printed on the first occurrence as well. Bug fixed
[#1636500](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/1636500).

`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STATISTICS` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEX_STATISTICS`
