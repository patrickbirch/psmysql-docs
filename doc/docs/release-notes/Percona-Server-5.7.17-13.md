## Bugs Fixed

*MyRocks* storage engine detection implemented in `mysqldump` in *Percona Server for MySQL* `5.6.17-12` was using a deprecated `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_VARIABLES` table, causing `mysqldump`
failures on servers running with the `show_compatibility_56` variable
set to `OFF`. Bug fixed [#1676401](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/+bug/1676401).
