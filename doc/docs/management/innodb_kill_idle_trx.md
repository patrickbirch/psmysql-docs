# Kill Idle Transactions

This feature limits the age of idle transactions, for all transactional storage
engines. If a transaction is idle for more seconds than the threshold
specified, it will be killed. This prevents users from blocking InnoDB purge
by mistake.

In *Percona Server for MySQL* Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.17-11 this feature has been re-implemented by
setting a connection socket read timeout value instead of periodically scanning
the internal InnoDB transaction list.

## Version Specific Information

> 
> * Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10-1: Feature ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6.


> * Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.17-11: Feature re-implemented using socket timeouts.
